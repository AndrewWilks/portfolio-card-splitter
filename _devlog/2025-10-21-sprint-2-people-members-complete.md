# 2025-10-21 - Sprint 2: People/Members Management Complete! 🎉

## 🎯 What I Accomplished

After wrapping up Sprint 1 (Merchants & Tags), I dove headfirst into Sprint 2 - implementing the complete People/Members management system. This was my first full CRUD implementation following the established Clean Architecture pattern, and wow, what a journey!

I built out the entire member management stack from database schema to API endpoints. The system now handles creating, reading, updating, and listing members with proper validation, business rules, and error handling. Members can be archived/unarchived, and the system prevents duplicate display names within the same user account.

## 🏗️ Technical Deep Dive

### Clean Architecture in Action

Following the layered architecture we established in Sprint 1, I implemented:

- **Entity Layer** (`shared/entities/member.ts`): The Member class with Zod validation, factory methods (`create()`, `from()`), and proper encapsulation
- **Repository Layer** (`backend/repositories/memberRepository.ts`): Full CRUD operations using Drizzle ORM with conflict resolution
- **Service Layer** (`backend/services/memberService.ts`): Business logic with request validation and duplicate prevention
- **Routes Layer** (`backend/routes/people/`): REST API endpoints with proper HTTP responses

### SOLID Principles Applied

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extended shared interfaces without modifying them
- **Liskov Substitution**: Backend implementations work seamlessly with shared interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused, minimal interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies on abstractions, not concretions

### TDD Workflow

I followed the Red-Green-Refactor cycle religiously:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while maintaining test coverage

The tests were already scaffolded from Sprint 1, so I focused on making them pass with proper implementations.

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Repository Pattern Power

The repository pattern really shines with Drizzle ORM. The `save()` method with `onConflictDoUpdate` handles both inserts and updates elegantly - no more manual checking if records exist.

### Validation at Every Layer

I implemented Zod schemas at multiple levels:

- Entity level: Core data validation
- Service level: Request validation with business rules
- Route level: HTTP request validation

This creates a robust defense-in-depth approach.

### Async Route Handlers

Had to fix the route registration system to properly support async handlers. The `createValidatedRoute` helper now accepts `Promise<Response>` return types.

## 🚀 What's Next

Sprint 3: Transaction Management - the core feature! This will be the most complex sprint yet, dealing with allocations, merchant associations, and financial calculations. I'm excited to tackle the business logic that makes this app actually useful for tracking shared expenses.

## 📊 Sprint 2 Stats

- **Files Modified**: 9
- **Tests Passing**: 102/102 ✅
- **API Endpoints**: 3 (GET, POST, PATCH)
- **Business Rules**: Duplicate prevention, archiving logic
- **Commits**: 3 (following TDD commit strategy)
