# Dev Diary Entry - 2025-10-30, 2025-10-31

Today, I figured that the structure that I was used to build the app was over engineered and making things more complex than they needed to be, especially in the backend. I am thinking of simplifying the structure by removing some layers of abstraction and making the code more straightforward.

To do this I think I'll have all zod schema live on the entity layer.
Move the validation middleware over to @Hono/zod-validator package.
Removing shared repositories as they are not needed.
Removing shared services as they are not needed.
I also added shared utilities for common functions.

- calculateAmountUsingBasisPoints
- calculateBasisPointsFromAmounts

I also added shared types for common types with zod schemas.

- Cents
- basisPoints
- HexColor

Still to work out what else ill do fo this refactor but I think this will make things easier to manage and understand and is a start.

Ill start with building out the all the entities now.
